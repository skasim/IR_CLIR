# A Comparative Study of Techniques for Hindi-to-English Cross-Language Information Retrieval

Culture and knowledge move seamlessly across digital borders, making it essential that Information Retrieval systems do so as well. This study evaluates the effectiveness of machine translation, multilingual embeddings, OOV transliteration, and pre- and post-query expansion in Hindi-to-English CLIR utilizing term, 4-gram, and 5-gram indices. 4-gram indices demonstrate the best CLIR performance among indices, especially for longer queries. The technical advances in machine translation tools result in better retrieval performance over word-to-word embedding translations. Thus, emphasizing the need for phrasal translation for improved CLIR performance. In addition, OOV transliteration and pre- and post-query translation showed effectiveness in enhancing embedding retrieval.
